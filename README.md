> The locations of the core components of this repo are outlined in the file system map below. In short, there are the following main directories:

 - Public_submission - contains the main .Rscripts, main Robjects, tables, raw data associated this manuscript (with exception of raw sequencing files). The subdirectories included here are mostly divided per datasets or experiment (RNA-seq, 16S-seq, S. aureus isolates data, mice-experimental data, ...).

 - Amorim2022_SupplemmentalTable1_LeishOmics_StudyDesign.txt - Clinical metadata associated with the patients included in this study (n=62).
 - /Bacterial_isolates/ - Contains information about the live bacterial isolates collected from CL lesions. See isolation process and methodology in the official manuscript.
 - /Biopsy_qPCR/ - contains the raw data from the 2 qPCR experiments included in this manuscript: L. braziliensis's 18S and total bacteria's 16S ribosomal subunits. Ps.: In some parts there are still included the code for a failed qPCR trying to quantify specifically S. aureus. This experiment was never included in the manuscript.
 - /Integrative_Analysis/ - TBD
 - /16S-seq/ - TBD
 - /RNA-seq/ - TBD
 - /Mice_experiments/ - TBD


Ps.: Include:
- sequencing QAs
- Photos?
- Details about each individual file.
